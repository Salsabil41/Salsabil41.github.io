<h2> The Causes and Effects</h2>
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Juniperprairiewilderness2006.jpg" alt="Florida Scrub">
  <p> There has been a major loss of habitat for these birds as the srcub has overgrown. This was due to human development (in terms of fire repression in the scrub) and as well as the fact that the birds can only survive in a very specific environment.
  The maximum height for the survival of the scrub jays is 10 feet, and the sand in the area should be well-drained so that vegetation doesn't rot. Other factors like pesticides also effect the birds as the insects they eat could be poisoned. Climate change is also playing a role with the severe hurricanes that hit Florida
    causing damage to their habitat.</p>
